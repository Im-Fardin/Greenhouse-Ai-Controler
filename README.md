ðŸŒ¿ Smart Climate Controller: Deep Learning Meets Fuzzy Logic

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a hybrid intelligent system that forecasts greenhouse climate variables using an LSTM-based neural network and applies fuzzy logic to make human-like control decisions. The goal is to emulate real-world greenhouse automation by combining the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of fuzzy reasoning.


ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To design and implement a lightweight yet professional-grade system that can:

- Forecast greenhouse temperature and humidity values 30â€“60 minutes into the future using time-series deep learning.

- Use those forecasts in a fuzzy inference system to simulate climate control actions (e.g., adjusting fans, lights, humidifiers).

- Provide clear, interactive visualizations of environmental conditions, model behavior, and control logic decisions.


ðŸ§ª Dataset
We use the publicly available Greenhouse Sensor Dataset, which contains environmental sensor data collected at 10-minute intervals, including:

- Greenhouse temperature (Â°C)

- Humidity (%)

- Illuminance (lux)

- VOCs and eCOâ‚‚ (optional for expansion)


ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Keras (LSTM model for multivariate time series forecasting)

- Scikit-Fuzzy (fuzzy logic control system)

- Streamlit (Future update: live dashboard interface)


ðŸš€ Project Highlights
- Fully modular codebase with components for preprocessing, forecasting, fuzzy reasoning, and visualization.

- Intelligent decision-making under uncertainty using linguistic fuzzy rules.

- Clean user interface for understanding climate trends and system behavior.

- Foundation for real-time greenhouse automation systems or IoT extensions.
